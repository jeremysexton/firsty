#Firsty

A Statamic modifier that returns the first word of a string.

##About

This probably already exists or is built into Statamic, but I couldn't find it. So, ya know, here ya go.

##Support, etc

Troll me on the tweets at [@jeremysexton](http://twitter.com/jeremysexton) or shoot me an email jeremy(at)jeremysexton.net.
